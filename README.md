# Specific Dynamics - F17 Humanitarian Hummingbird

## Our Mission

At Specific Dynamics, we are passionate about building a better world through engineering and innovation. We are pioneers in the domain of electrical, mechanical, and aerospace engineering, running on the cutting edge of efficiency, precision, and technology. We believe in creating a brighter future through humanitarian and technological execellence, while pushing the limits of possibility. Our team thrives on challenge, flourishing in pursuit of perfection, and continually redefining the frontiers of humanity. Through our creations, we strive to lead the industry in creating the next generation of sustainable aerospace systems, doing more with less and ensuring that nothing goes to waste. Our mission is to cultiavte people and production, laying the foundation for the next generation of engineers and innovators. Specific Dynamics — A Higher Purpose.

## Our Founder

Specific Dynamics was founded by our dear leader, Vikram Andrew Procter, on December 13th, 2025, amidst the chaos and struggles of the modern world. Our dear leader worked tirelessly to create a change — Specific Dynamics — while simultaneously pursuing residence as a neurosurgeon at John Hopkins University, a law degree at Harvard Law, and a Ph.D in Electrical Engineering at M.I.T. He single handedly created the resistor, and had his pioneering work in circuit theory, better known as Ohm's Law, stolen from him by malicious conspirators. In contrast to his greatness, our great leader came from humble beginnings. Our dear leader was born into a modest middle class family, scarcely earning more that a single million per annum. As a child, our brave leader faced many challenges, the stresses of choosing which car to drive each morning and which brand of caviar to have each night burdened him greatly. Despite this, our leader would rise to greatness, making his first billion dollars at the young age of twelve while climbing Mount Everest without an oxygen tank in only a quarter zip and Amiri jeans. Among other things, our great leader was also responsible for discovering penicillin, inventing the transistor, ideating quantum physics, and being the first to discover and contact extraterrestrial life. We dedicate this project to the honour of a great man, and our glorious leader! Heil, Vikram!
